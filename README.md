# sml-helpers
Random collection of helper functions and algorithms I rewrite frequently / use sometime that don't merit their own repo.

- Data structures are in libs/
- Algorithm implementations are in algorithms/ or libs/
- "Useful" functions are in utils/
- Puzzle game solvers are in vidya/

# Future Plans:
- Add some list utils
- Add some int utils
- Add matrix data structures
- Add graph data structures
- Generic BFS solver
- Generic DFS solver
- Sudoku
- Minesweeper
- Generic maze solver
- Add other pathfinding algorithms
- Add hexgrid data structure
- Hexcells
- Squarecells
- Tenrow
